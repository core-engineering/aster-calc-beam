# aster-calc-beam

## Description
The goal of this piece of aster code is to show the possibilities of interactions with pandas and matplotlib :
- Pandas is used to import section database and to use it directly in AFFE_CARA_ELEM.
- During post-treatment, pandas and matplotlib are used to plot some results on the beam length.

## Use
_/opt/aster/bin/as_run CalcBeam.export_ will do the job if all filenames are updated and if pandas is accessible from code aster.
